# CAsset
This is a R package to provide financial data from China's market. The following data are included now:

* stock hisitorical prices and volumn and trading dates
* financial reports on stocks listed in China's market and their reporting dates, good for backtesting
* indexes on different assets with their historical quotes
* mutual funds and their navs, holdings, and basic statistics
* functions for performance analysis(you need the datebase hosted on my local postgresql unfortunately, but if you would like to take the trouble, mail me to get the raw data)

This package is initially designed for my Chinese students, so all man files are written in Chinese. If you need assistance on language
please contact me at lh_loki "at" 163.com
